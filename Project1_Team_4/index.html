                            <h2>Introduction</h2>
                            <p>The Internet was first developed in the United States during the 1950s. The original concept came about during the Cold War, which was a 
                                proxy war between the US and USSR, when the US wanted to devlop a communication network that could not be disrupted by Soviet nuclear
                                attacks. The first major development group formed by the US government was the Advanced Research Project Agency (ARPA) in 1958. By the 
                                1970s, Arpanet was fully developed an begai expanding use outside of the government and military. By 1973, 30 acedemic, military, and
                                research institutions had join the network across the US, Norway, and the UK. After the introduction of TCP/IP in 1974, Arpanet quickly
                                grew into a global interconnected network of computers, or internet. The Arpanet was decommissioned in 1990 <br>
                                <br>
                                In the 1990s, web browsers sky rocketed in popularity, one of the first being the Mosaic browser, created in 1993. This opened the door
                                for non-academics to browse the internet and boosted the interest in easy implementations of html so that people can make their own
                                websites. From 1993 to 1996, the number of websites on the World Wide Web grew from 130 to over 100,000. 1994 brougt with it Netscape Navigator,
                                one of the most popular browsers before the creation of Google, which hosted over 10 million users by 1995.

                            <h2>Web 3.0 Growth</h2>
                            <p>It is a common belief that there have been 2 past stages of the internet and we have recently entered into the third, Web 3.0. 
                                Web 1.0 encompassed the early days of the internet and the World Wide Web where almost all websites were read only, offering very little user
                                interaction. Web 2.0 really took off with te growth of social media and e-commrce in the late 90s and early 2000s. Web 2.0 is the name given
                                to the phase of the internet focused on user input. This is the generation most of the internet is currently in. <br>
                                <br>
                                Web 3.0 is a new and growing generation built around decentralization and automatic content generation. You hear this term a lot regarding
                                blockchain and cryptocurrencies. The idea behind these concepts is that information should be public and owned by the people using it, not major
                                centralized companies. This school of thought also applies to currencies, taking the power away from government agencies and putting it in the
                                hands of the public. The biggest example of this is Bitcoin, both the largest cryptocurrency and blockchain in the world. <br>
                                <br>
                                The other large contributor to he concept of Web 3.0 is automatic content generation, largely focused around A.I. This concept really took off
                                last year when the A.I. chatbot Chat GPT took over the internet, but it isn't exclusve to chatbots. A.I. is being implemented in almost every
                                digital industry. From customer service and artisty to law firms and online content creation, people are finding new and innovative ways to utilize
                                artificial intelegency to make common jobs easier.  </p>
